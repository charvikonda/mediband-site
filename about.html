        <h2>The MediBand Story</h2>
        <div class="story-content">
          <div class="story-text">
            <p><strong>It started with a simple question:</strong> "What if emergency responders could access critical medical information in seconds, not minutes?"</p>
            
            <p>In 2022, partners Charvi Konda and Nitya Shah witnessed firsthand how precious time was lost during medical emergencies due to communication barriers and inaccessible medical records. They recognized that existing solutions weren't designed with accessibility and inclusivity as core principles.</p>
            
            <p>Drawing from their backgrounds in healthcare technology and inclusive design, they founded MediBand with a revolutionary vision: create a smart wristband that could bridge the gap between emergency response and personal medical data, while ensuring no one was left behind due to disability, language barriers, or economic constraints.</p>
            
            <p><strong>From startup to healthcare revolution:</strong> What began as a DECA competition project has evolved into a comprehensive healthcare technology platform trusted by over 500 hospitals, 300 universities, and millions of users worldwide.</p>
